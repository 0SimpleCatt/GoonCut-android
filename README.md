## Building Instructions
*One Gradle command builds the app: it compiles the Rust engine with [cargo-ndk](https://github.com/bbqsrc/cargo-ndk) and generates the Kotlin bindings. FFmpeg and sherpa-onnx are fetched and built first, once.*

* Clone this repository
* Make sure you have at least 10 GB of free disk space
* In `src`, with `ANDROID_HOME` pointing at your Android SDK:
  ```
  scripts/ffmpeg-mobile.sh aarch64-linux-android
  scripts/sherpa-mobile.sh aarch64-linux-android
  eval "$(scripts/mobile-env.sh aarch64-linux-android)"
  ```
* then enter `src/crates/capcraft-android/android` and run `./gradlew assembleRelease`.

Build time dependencies:

<details>
  <summary>required tools</summary>

  ```
      Linux or macOS (on Windows, WSL)
      rustup (it installs the Rust release rust-toolchain.toml names)
      rustup target add aarch64-linux-android
      cargo install cargo-ndk --version 4.1.2 --locked
      Android SDK (API 37) and NDK 29.0.14206865
      JDK 17 or newer
      cmake, make, clang (libclang-dev), curl
  ```
</details>

*Builds are only tested in WSL Ubuntu on Windows 11.*
